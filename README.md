# RADiQL application suite for HMRC

GOV.UK hosts a number of Digital services for various govenment
departments. One of these is HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). HMRC,
along with other UK government departments, under the influence
and guidance of the Government Digital Service (GDS), is rolling
out Digital Services across its business.

GOV.UK is publishing a number of RESTful APIs and HMRC Digital
Services represent some of these. The newer services tend to 
use JSON as a request/response data interchange format, though
some services still use XML for this purpose.

## RADiQL Services for HMRC

AppStratum intends to use RADiQL to build commercial services
for HMRC and other UK Government departments using the RADiQL
toolset to do this. Planned applications are:
